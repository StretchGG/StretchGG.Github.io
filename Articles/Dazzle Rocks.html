        <h1>Dazzle Rocks: Working On A Social Sandbox MMO For Mobile</h1>
        <article>
          <p>I'm always on the lookout for Mobile MMO's. Usually they don't tend to be that great but I recently came across the game developer Dazzle Rocks. They appear to be working on a Minecraft type MMO that looks really promising. </p>
          <p> There isn't much information about the game out right now but from what we can see on their website, players have the ability to edit the terrain, gather resources and build.</p>
          <p>I'm wondering how it will all work. Will players be given their own island or plot of land to build on? will it aim to be open world? We'll have to wait and see.</p>
          <br>

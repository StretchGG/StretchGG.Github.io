        <h1>The Warhammer Online Private Server Review</h1>

        <article>
          <h3>Summary:</h3>
          <p>Return of Reckoning is a fantastic Warhammer Online Private server and I would wholeheartedly recommend it.
            While it is more catered to PvP (Realm vs Realm) there is PvE content to level through and end game PvE
            content to progress through. It’s completely free so there is no reason not to try it!</p>
          <br>

          <h3>Background:</h3>
          <p>Warhammer Online - Age of Reckoning was a Warhammer Fantasy based MMO with very heavy emphasis on PvP. A
            private server was established in 2014 to bring this game back. It has been getting weekly updates ever
            since and currently has most of the content implemented. </p>
          <br>

          <h3>Classes:</h3>
          <p>There are two factions: Order and Destruction. Each Faction has 3 different races to pick from and then
            there are a further 4 classes to pick from between each race. It has your standard MMO archetypes of Tanks,
            Healers, Ranged DPS and Melee DPS. While some classes only have the standard archetype role, many of the
            classes have a secondary role. For example Order’s Warrior priest is a healer but can also play as a Melee
            DPS.</p>
          <p>The classes between factions are mirrored. Using our example of Warrior Priest, if you wanted to play a
            Melee DPS that can also heal on Destruction, you can play Disciple of Khaine. However the mirrored classes
            aren’t direct copies. They vary in play-style and skills. </p>
          <br>

          <h3>PvE:</h3>
          <p>It has your standard MMO quests however the real fun (in my opinion) is with Public Quests. </p>

          <p>Public Quests are open world PvE events that consist of a few stages. Each stage has you complete different
            tasks to get to the next stage. They are usually group events and its a lot of fun to group up and complete
            it with other players. Loot for Public Quests are determined by your contribution towards completing it and
            loot roll.</p>

          <p>For end game content there are also raid like content to work through.</p>
          <br>

          <h3>RvR (PvP)</h3>
          <p>Realm vs Realm is where this game shines. It has been one of the funniest PvP systems I’ve ever played.
            Most maps have a dedicated area for RvR. It revolves around controlling battlefield objectives and keeps.
            The goal is to hold all battlefield objectives and lock the zone for your Realm.</p>
          <p>Since its not instanced, anyone can join! This means you could have huge battles between factions.</p>
          <p>They do have instanced PvP (scenarios) which is more structured PvP if you prefer that over open world pvp.
          </p>
